        <summary>a proxy server that opens a secure connection between a Sauce Labs virtual machine and an application or website on your local machine or behind a corporate firewall</summary>
        <description>Sauce Connect™ is a proxy server that opens a secure connection between a Sauce Labs virtual machine running your browser tests, and an application or website you want to test that's on your local machine or behind a corporate firewall. Sauce Connect is not required to run tests with Sauce Labs, but only in situations where the website or application you want to test is not publicly accessible. It is strongly recommended that you work with a network engineer to install Sauce Connect, as network architectures can be complex.

The `sc.exe` file is installed as `sauce-connect.exe` to avoid name conflict with the Windows Service Control (SC).</description>
